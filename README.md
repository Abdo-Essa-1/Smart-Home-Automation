# Smart-Home-Automation

Project Highlights:

- Lighting Control: Automatically adjusts based on ambient light using an LDR sensor and LED indicators.
- Fan Speed Control: Dynamically adjusts fan speed based on room temperature using the LM35 temperature sensor and PWM control.
- Fire Detection: Utilizes a flame sensor to detect fire, triggers a buzzer, and displays a critical alert on the LCD.
- Real-time Display: Temperature, light intensity, and system status are shown on a 16x2 LCD.

Hardware Used:

- ATmega32 microcontroller
- LDR, LM35 temperature sensor, and flame sensor
- PWM-controlled fan motor
- LCD display and LED indicators
